To use this little administration you need to !! merge !! these directories with fresh StaticPHP framework installation (excluding this README file:).
Next step is to set up config/admin.php file properly.
config.php -> $config['autoload'] = array('helpers/system', 'models/user_model', 'libraries/form_validation');
table_users.sql
And you are done.

Now open http://your_domain/path_to_framework/public/language
default username and password is root:root
